# Mine-Memory
This web app is me familiarizing myself familiarizing myself with modern web technologies such as: Meteor, MongoDB &amp; Iorn Router. So what am i building. As a big brother i decided to help my brother become a pro at minecraft. You see, its very easy to get lost in that open world so i suggested a system that logs the coordinates of your house and other items you find around the map. you can kind of say i went a bit overboard with the website and app.
